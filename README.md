# koradcharger
This is an interface for a Korad KA3005 bench power supply and scripting that
allows computer-controlled CC/CV charging of Li-Ion batteries (e.g., type
18650) along with logging. It has configurable cutoffs for residual current and
time cutoffs as well.

## Disclaimer
Before you charge your Li-Ion batteries with a bench power supply, make sure
you know what you're doing.  If you burn your house down, that's on you, not
me. Even if I wrote the code.
